# <h1>Sleepy Ninja</h1>

Sleepy ninja allows the user to play randomly as one of four characters, Sleepy Ninja, Angry Ninja, Happy Ninja, and Naruto.
Press 'Space' to jump over deadly ninja stars. Beware, they all come at you at different speeds! Some of them even come from the air...

If you wish to run the game on your own computer, ensure that you run it on a local server! 
Side note: Sleepy Ninja runs best on 60hz monitors.
